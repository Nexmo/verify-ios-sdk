assign, distribute, make any commercial use of, use on a timeshare or service bureau basis or otherwise commercialize the SDK

4. SUPPORT AND UPGRADES.  If Nexmo provides you with any upgrades, patches, enhancements or fixes for the SDK that it makes 
generally available free of charge in connection with the SDK (“Updates”), then the items that are provided will become part of

enhancements, fixes or any other support to you for the SDK.

5.  INDEMNITY.  You agree that Nexmo shall have no liability whatsoever for any use you make of the SDK.  You hereby agree to

under this Agreement cease; you must cease exercise of the licensed rights herein; you must destroy or remove from all hard

YOUR RIGHTS TO THE SDK MAY CAUSE YOUR PRODUCT(S) TO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY, AND NEXMO WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY 
WHATSOEVER AS A RESULT THEREOF.

10. FREEDOM TO OPERATE.  You agree that Nexmo may collect or you may provide to Nexmo (or publicly)  comments, feedback,

ion or derivative work thereof to support any nuclear proliferation, chemical weapons, biological weapons or missile proliferation activity.

shall be reformed to the limited extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed 
in accordance with the laws of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.  California will have exclusive
