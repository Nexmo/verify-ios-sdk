The Nexmo Verify iOS SDK
============

With Verify SDK you add password replacement, 2-factor authentication, or user and transaction verification to your App with a single line of code.

Verify SDK:
 - Adds a new level of security to your App by tying phone numbers to unique device IDs.
 - Provides user management support. You easily manage user identity across multiple devices and platforms without building a complex user management backend. No need to create and manage a user database, or query your database on each login request.
 - Enables you to re-verify users with push notifications.
 - Offers a UX framework to integrate in your App.
